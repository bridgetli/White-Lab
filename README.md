# White-Lab
Code I've written for my research position in the White Lab at MIT.

### Code use:
Each folder contains a different subproject.
Please see .py files inside folders for code and descriptions about what the code does.
The rest of the files in each folder are inputs or outputs

### Project summary:

This is only the code from the first half of my UROP (Fall 2020 and not Spring 2021).
Unfortunately, I lost the second half of my code when my laptop broke. However, the slide deck PDF contains results from the entire UROP.
